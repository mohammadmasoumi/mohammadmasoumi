## What I do

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on c-tutorial which is an open-source project that I'll share what I've learned in C.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning rust.


## About me

I started learning and becoming a developer when I was at university. Until now Iâ€™ve been trying to hone
my skills in both DevOps and Backend. Although I prefer to work as a backend developer, 
I feel comfortable working as a front-end developer occasionally.

I am ambitious adventurous assiduous animated and so eager to learn new skills and improve my current ones and also I am open to trying new experiences and new technologies.

I would expect to work in a team with great teamwork and collaboration and having professional
members and also in a motivating environment with enthusiastic peoples involved.
